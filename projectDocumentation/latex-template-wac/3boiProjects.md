### Mcluhan.js project with the bois
3 people code, their code is sent to a fourth computer  
- person1 - mcluhan.js (exclusively?)
- person2 - gibberwocky
- person3 - gibberwocky
- computer4 - receiving all code text with socket, max/msp (shell obj), use code text to generate poetry with rita.js(?), maybe use a phone number and have people text the computer and/or send an email to the computer.  
fourth computer displays the info and is graphically stylized with p5.js  
eventually, fourth computer codes by itself  

Tate will talk to Ben about the library, build and update mcluhan  
Tony test gibberwocky text transmission  
Chase will start to learn gibberwocky, collaborative max patch (1 for performers, 1 for computer4 to received), max shell commands, etc.  
1 page from all 3 laptops  
socket.io, as you are typing, send the code out (referring to gibberwocky)
